#' Group nodes by community
#'
#' @description
#' Reorders the graph to group nodes in the same community together.
#' Useful for viewing community structure of a graph using a `heatmap()`.
#'
#' @details
#' Communities are ordered by size, so nodes in the largest community are
#' first. Within a community, nodes are order by highest-to-lowest degree.
#'
#' If membership is in matrix form (the output from [speakeasyR::cluster()]
#' with `subcluster` > 1) a matrix is returned with the indices for level one
#' in row 1 and level n in row n. Each row reorders the communities of the
#' previous row such that, at the second level, nodes are still grouped by
#' the first level communities. This allows the hierarchical structure to be
#' viewed.
#'
#' See vignette for a multilevel example.
#'
#' @param graph The graph or adjacency matrix the membership vector was created
#'   for.
#' @param membership A vector or matrix listing node communities. The output
#'   from [speakeasyR::cluster()] (should also work for other clustering
#'   algorithms that return membership in the same format).
#' @param is_directed Whether the graph should be treated as directed or not.
#'   By default, if the graph is symmetric it is treated as undirected.
#'
#' @return An index vector or matrix. The number of rows are equal to the value
#'   of `subcluster` passed to [speakeasyR::cluster()].
